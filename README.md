# Omnihilux
Graphical prototype of Omnihilux, my proposed game design for the GACCI competition by Binus University.

## Disclaimer
This project is unfortunately written in Java (huge ew) as I didn't have enough time to implement my own Rust (ðŸš€) game engine, and [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) lacks important 2D features.
